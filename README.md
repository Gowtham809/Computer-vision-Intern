# Abstract
The objective is to enhance the accuracy of analyzing a basketball player's dribbling drills in a video. Various methods, including trajectory analysis of the ball, optical flow of objects, and automatic object outline/border detection, are employed. Additionally, a focus on basketball dribble count is integrated to improve the precision of the analysis. The goal is to leverage these computer vision techniques to gain insights into the player's movements and enhance the overall understanding of the dribbling exercises in the video.
